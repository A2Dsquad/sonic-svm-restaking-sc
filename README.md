## Structure

### Main components

### States

#### StakePool

The `StakePool` struct is responsible for managing a collection of staked SOL tokens, tracking validator stakes, and handling user deposits and withdrawals. It interacts with Solana's staking program and uses various accounts to facilitate staking operations.

- `manager`: The public key of the stake pool's manager.

- `staker`: The public key of the staker responsible for managing stake delegation.

- `stake_deposit_authority`: The public key that authorizes stake deposits.

- `validator_list`: The public key of the validator list account tracking stake accounts.

- `reserve_stake`: The public key of the stake pool's reserve stake account.

- `pool_mint`: The public key of the pool token mint (represents ownership in the stake pool).

- `manager_fee_account`: The account receiving fees from staking rewards.

- `token_program_id`: The public key of the associated token program.

- `total_lamports`: Total lamports held in the stake pool.

- `pool_token_supply`: Total supply of stake pool tokens.

- `last_epoch_total_lamports`: The total lamports in the last epoch.

#### Stake Pool Validation Functions

This document provides an overview of the key validation functions used in the Stake Pool program. These functions ensure the correctness and security of various accounts and authorities.

##### `check_manager_fee_info`
**Purpose:**
Validates that the manager fee account is a valid token program account capable of receiving tokens from the mint.

**Checks Performed:**
- The account belongs to the expected token program.
- The account is initialized.
- The mint associated with the account matches the pool‚Äôs mint.
- The account does not have unsupported extensions.

---

##### `check_authority_withdraw`
**Purpose:**
Verifies that the provided withdraw authority is correct.

**Checks Performed:**
- Uses `check_program_derived_authority` to validate if the withdraw authority is correctly derived.

---

##### `check_stake_deposit_authority`
**Purpose:**
Validates the stake deposit authority.

**Checks Performed:**
- Ensures the provided stake deposit authority matches the one stored in the pool.

---

##### `check_sol_deposit_authority`
**Purpose:**
Validates the SOL deposit authority if it is set.

**Checks Performed:**
- If a deposit authority exists, checks if the provided authority matches.
- Ensures the authority has signed the transaction.

---

##### `check_sol_withdraw_authority`
**Purpose:**
Validates the SOL withdraw authority if it is set.

**Checks Performed:**
- If a withdraw authority exists, checks if the provided authority matches.
- Ensures the authority has signed the transaction.

---

##### `check_mint`
**Purpose:**
Ensures that the provided mint account matches the pool mint.

**Checks Performed:**
- Compares the mint account‚Äôs key with the pool mint.
- Retrieves and returns the mint‚Äôs decimal precision.

---

##### `check_manager`
**Purpose:**
Validates the manager‚Äôs identity and signature.

**Checks Performed:**
- Ensures the provided manager matches the stored manager key.
- Verifies that the manager has signed the transaction.

---

##### `check_staker`
**Purpose:**

**Checks Performed:**
- Ensures the provided staker matches the stored staker key.
- Verifies that the staker has signed the transaction.

#### Validator Stake Info

This section describes the `ValidatorList` struct, which is responsible for maintaining a list of validator stake accounts in the pool.

##### `ValidatorList`
**Purpose:**
The `ValidatorList` struct acts as a storage container for all validator stake accounts within the stake pool. It provides efficient access and management of validator-related staking data.

**Fields:**
- `header`: Stores metadata about the validator list. This is separated from the list itself to optimize deserialization performance.
- `validators`: A `Vec<ValidatorStakeInfo>` containing detailed staking information for each validator associated with the pool.

**Key Considerations:**
- The `ValidatorList` is designed to support efficient updates and queries, ensuring that validator stake accounts are managed effectively.
- Separating the `header` from the `validators` list reduces the computational overhead when processing the validator list.
- The structure supports serialization and deserialization via `Borsh`, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of validator data.

#### Validator List Header

This section describes the `ValidatorListHeader` struct, which serves as a helper type to deserialize the beginning of a `ValidatorList`.

##### `ValidatorListHeader`
**Purpose:**
The `ValidatorListHeader` struct contains metadata for a `ValidatorList`, providing key details about the structure and constraints of the validator list.

**Fields:**
- `account_type`: Specifies the type of account. It must currently be set to `ValidatorList`.
- `max_validators`: Defines the maximum number of validator stake accounts that can be included in the `ValidatorList`.

**Key Considerations:**
- This struct enables quick deserialization of only the essential metadata without requiring full list deserialization.
- The `max_validators` field ensures that the stake pool adheres to predefined constraints on the number of validators.
- Supports `Borsh` serialization and deserialization for efficient data handling.

#### Validator Stake Info

This section describes the `ValidatorStakeInfo` struct, which contains information about a validator's stake in the pool.

##### `ValidatorStakeInfo`
**Purpose:**
The `ValidatorStakeInfo` struct stores essential details about a validator's stake, including active and transient stake amounts, status, and vote account address.

**Fields:**
- `active_stake_lamports`: The total amount of lamports in the validator's stake account, including rent. If `last_update_epoch` does not match the current epoch, this value may be outdated.
- `transient_stake_lamports`: The amount of transient stake delegated to this validator. This value may be inaccurate if `last_update_epoch` is outdated.
- `last_update_epoch`: The last epoch when `active_stake_lamports` and `transient_stake_lamports` were updated.
- `transient_seed_suffix`: A suffix used to derive the transient stake account address.
- `unused`: A reserved field, initially intended for specifying the end of seed suffixes.
- `validator_seed_suffix`: A seed suffix for the validator account. This is effectively `Option<NonZeroU32>`, where `0` represents `None`.
- `status`: The current status of the validator's stake account.
- `vote_account_address`: The validator's vote account address.

**Key Considerations:**
- The **order of fields** is critical for correct deserialization, as this struct is directly interpreted using `bytemuck` transmute.
- The structure is optimized for minimal BPF instructions by avoiding unnecessary alignment padding.
- Supports `Borsh` serialization and deserialization for efficient data handling.

#### Fee Structure

This section describes the `Fee` struct, which defines the fee rate as a ratio. The fee is minted on `UpdateStakePoolBalance` as a proportion of the rewards.

##### `Fee`
**Purpose:**
The `Fee` struct represents a fraction used to determine the fee amount based on the rewards generated in the stake pool.

**Fields:**
- `denominator`: The denominator of the fee ratio.
- `numerator`: The numerator of the fee ratio.

**Key Considerations:**
- If either the `numerator` or `denominator` is `0`, the fee is considered to be `0`.
- The fee is applied as a proportional value during the stake pool balance update process.
- Supports `Borsh` serialization and deserialization for efficient data handling.

  - Plus the rent-exempt amount.
- If the validator has any remaining stake, it will first be moved to a transient stake account for deactivation.
- Only the staker has the authority to remove validators from the pool.

#### `DecreaseValidatorStake` (Deprecated)
**Purpose:**  
This instruction has been **deprecated** since version **0.7.0**.

- **`transient_stake_seed: u64`** ‚Äì The seed used to create the transient stake account.

**Key Considerations:**
- The instruction only succeeds if the transient stake account **does not exist**.
- The amount of lamports to move must be at least:
  - Rent-exemption amount
  - Plus `max(crate::MINIMUM_ACTIVE_STAKE, solana_program::stake::tools::get_minimum_delegation())`
- This instruction helps rebalance the stake pool without the staker taking custody of funds.

#### `IncreaseValidatorStake`
**Purpose:**  
Allows the staker to increase the stake of a validator by splitting stake from the reserve stake account into a transient stake account and delegating it to the validator.  

##### Accounts:

##### Parameters:
- **`lamports: u64`** ‚Äì The amount of lamports to increase on the given validator.
- **`transient_stake_seed: u64`** ‚Äì The seed used to create the transient stake account.

**Key Considerations:**
- The instruction only succeeds if the transient stake account **does not exist**.
- The minimum amount to move is:
  - Rent-exemption amount  
  - Plus `max(crate::MINIMUM_ACTIVE_STAKE, solana_program::stake::tools::get_minimum_delegation())`
- The actual amount split into the transient stake account is: lamports + stake_rent_exemption
- The rent-exemption amount of the stake account is withdrawn back to the reserve after it is merged.
- `UpdateValidatorListBalance` will merge the stake once it is ready.

#### `SetPreferredValidator`
**Purpose:**  
Allows the staker to set or unset a preferred validator for deposit or withdrawal operations in the stake pool.  
This helps prevent users from exploiting the pool as a free conversion service between SOL staked on different validators.

##### Accounts:
1. `[w]` **Stake Pool** ‚Äì The stake pool where the preferred validator setting applies.
2. `[s]` **Stake Pool Staker** ‚Äì The authorized staker managing the pool settings.
3. `[]` **Validator List** ‚Äì Stores the list of validators associated with the stake pool.

##### Parameters:
- **`validator_type: PreferredValidatorType`** ‚Äì Specifies whether the setting applies to deposits or withdrawals.
- **`validator_vote_address: Option<Pubkey>`** ‚Äì The validator's vote account that deposits or withdrawals must go through. If `None`, the preferred validator restriction is removed.

**Key Considerations:**
- The instruction **fails** if the specified validator is not part of the stake pool.
- By enforcing deposits and withdrawals through a specific validator, the pool avoids being used as a free SOL conversion mechanism.
- If `validator_vote_address` is `None`, any validator can be used for deposits and withdrawals.

#### `UpdateValidatorListBalance`
**Purpose:**  
Updates the balances of validator and transient stake accounts in the stake pool.  

This instruction processes each pair of validator and transient stake accounts, applying the following logic:
- If the **transient stake** is **inactive**, it is merged into the **reserve stake account**.
- If the **transient stake** is **active** and has **matching credits observed**, it is merged into the **canonical validator stake account**.
- In all other cases, no merging occurs, and the balance is simply added to the **canonical stake account balance**.

##### Accounts:
1. `[]` **Stake Pool** ‚Äì The stake pool where validator balances are updated.
2. `[]` **Stake Pool Withdraw Authority** ‚Äì Authority to manage the stake pool.
3. `[w]` **Validator Stake List Storage Account** ‚Äì Stores the list of validators and their associated stake accounts.
4. `[w]` **Reserve Stake Account** ‚Äì Receives merged inactive transient stake.
5. `[]` **Sysvar Clock** ‚Äì Provides the current cluster time.
6. `[]` **Sysvar Stake History** ‚Äì Records the history of stake changes.
7. `[]` **Stake Program** ‚Äì The Solana stake program.
8. `..7+2N` `[]` ‚Äì **N pairs** of validator and transient stake accounts.

##### Parameters:
- **`start_index: u32`** ‚Äì The index in the validator list to start updating from.
- **`no_merge: bool`** ‚Äì If `true`, merging of transient stake accounts into the reserve or validator stake account is skipped.  
  - This can be useful for **testing** or if a **stake account is in an invalid state**, but balance updates are still required.

**Key Considerations:**
- Ensures stake pool balances remain accurate by synchronizing transient and validator stake accounts.
- Merging logic prevents unnecessary fragmentation of stake accounts.
- The `no_merge` flag allows selective updates without merging, useful for debugging or handling edge cases.

#### `UpdateStakePoolBalance`
**Purpose:**  
Updates the total stake pool balance by summing the balances of the **reserve stake account** and all **validator stake accounts**.

This ensures that the stake pool‚Äôs accounting remains accurate and reflects the true amount of stake under management.

##### Accounts:
1. `[w]` **Stake Pool** ‚Äì The stake pool whose balance needs updating.
2. `[]` **Stake Pool Withdraw Authority** ‚Äì The authority managing withdrawals from the stake pool.
3. `[w]` **Validator Stake List Storage Account** ‚Äì Stores the list of validators and their associated stake accounts.
4. `[]` **Reserve Stake Account** ‚Äì The stake account holding unstaked or deactivated SOL.
5. `[w]` **Account to Receive Pool Fee Tokens** ‚Äì The account designated to receive any fees collected by the stake pool.
6. `[w]` **Pool Mint Account** ‚Äì The token mint for issuing new stake pool tokens.
7. `[]` **Pool Token Program** ‚Äì The token program managing stake pool tokens.

##### Key Considerations:
- Ensures that the total stake pool balance remains **accurate**.
- Includes **stake from validators** and **reserve stake**.
- **Fees may be collected** and sent to the designated fee account.
- Stake pool tokens may be **minted** to reflect changes in the stake pool's value.

This instruction is crucial for maintaining correct accounting in the stake pool and ensuring that stake pool token holders receive accurate value.

#### `CleanupRemovedValidatorEntries`
**Purpose:**  
Removes validator stake account entries that are marked as **`ReadyForRemoval`** from the validator stake list. This helps maintain an optimized and clean validator list.

##### Accounts:
1. `[]` **Stake Pool** ‚Äì The stake pool from which validator entries will be removed.
2. `[w]` **Validator Stake List Storage Account** ‚Äì Stores the list of validators and their associated stake accounts. This account will be modified to remove obsolete entries.

##### Key Considerations:
- Only **entries marked as `ReadyForRemoval`** will be deleted.
- Helps **optimize storage** by cleaning up outdated validator entries.
- Ensures the **validator stake list remains accurate** and up to date.
- This instruction does **not affect active validators**; only those explicitly flagged for removal will be deleted.

This is a **maintenance** instruction that keeps the stake pool's validator list efficient and free from unnecessary entries.

#### `DepositStake`
**Purpose:**  
Allows users to deposit **stake** into the stake pool. In return, they receive **pool tokens**, representing their proportional ownership in the pool. The deposited stake is merged with the appropriate validator stake account.

##### Accounts:

5. `[w]` **Stake Account to Join the Pool** ‚Äì The user‚Äôs stake account being deposited.
   - **Withdraw authority** for this stake account must first be set to the **stake pool deposit authority**.
6. `[w]` **Validator Stake Account** ‚Äì The validator stake account where the deposit will be merged.
7. `[w]` **Reserve Stake Account** ‚Äì Used to withdraw the **rent-exempt reserve** if necessary.
8. `[w]` **User Account to Receive Pool Tokens** ‚Äì The user‚Äôs account where the corresponding pool tokens will be credited.
9. `[w]` **Pool Fee Token Account** ‚Äì Receives a portion of the deposit as fees for the stake pool.
10. `[w]` **Referral Fee Token Account** ‚Äì Optional account to receive a portion of the fees as a referral incentive.
11. `[w]` **Pool Token Mint Account** ‚Äì Mints pool tokens to represent the deposited stake.
